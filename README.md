# Matplotlib-challenge
# Data Class Assignment 4 
This repository contains a pandas project that analysis treatment data on lab mice. The data analysed is located in the Resources folder. The pandas project pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb, combines Mouse_metadata.crv and Study_results.crv and generates several plots to display their data.
The code performs the following: it removes duplicate mouse ID data from the set; it generates a summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen; using both Panda's 'DataFrame.plot()' and Matplotlib's 'pyplot', this code generates a bar plot to display the number of total mice for each treatment regimen throughout the course of the study as well as a pie plot displaying the distribution of male and female mice in the study; it calculates the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin and calculates the quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determines if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens; using Matplotlib, this code generates a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens and highlights any potential outliers in the plot by changing their color and style; it generates a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for a mouse that was treated with Capomulin; it generates a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen; it calculates the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment, and plots the linear regression model on top of the mouse weight versus average tumor volume scatter plot.
